# GitHub Release Notes Copier

The **GitHub Release Notes Copier** is a lightweight, client-side web application built with vanilla JavaScript that fetches GitHub release notes and outputs a simplified JSON structure. This project is particularly useful in an era of Large Language Models (LLMs) because it enables you to quickly pass the latest release notes to an LLM, helping you get caught up on whatâ€™s relevant with minimal effort.

## Overview

With this tool, you simply provide the URL of a GitHub repository's releases page and optionally a version tag. The app fetches the release notes via GitHubâ€™s API into a clean JSON structure.

## Features

- **Vanilla JavaScript Implementation:** No frameworks needed. Easy to understand and extend.
- **Flexible Fetch Options:** 
  - Fetch a specific number of the latest releases.
  - Fetch all releases up to a given version tag.

## Why Itâ€™s Useful with LLMs

LLMs excel at parsing and summarizing structured data. By using this tool to obtain the latest release notes in a consistent JSON format, you can:
- **Quickly Extract Insights:** Feed the JSON into an LLM to extract key updates, changes, or summaries of new features.
- **Stay Focused:** Get an LLM to highlight the most relevant updates for your needs, saving time in manual review.
